I love playing Minecraft. It's my favorite way to spend my day. I usually start by mining some resources, like wood, stone and iron. Then I build a cozy house with a fireplace and a bed. Sometimes I encounter some hostile mobs, like zombies, skeletons and creepers. They try to kill me, but I'm too smart for them. I use my sword and bow to fight them off, or I run away and hide in my house.
